## Build Notes, Backlog & Portfolio

Welcome to my working notebook. I use this page like a lightweight blog: short updates on what I shipped, what I learned, and what I am building next.

### 2026-02-20 — Rebuilding this site as markdown-first
**Tags:** site, writing, workflow

I wanted updates to be fast and frictionless, so I moved the content into markdown instead of hardcoded JSX sections.

Now I can publish backlog or portfolio changes by editing one file and committing.

- Better writing flow
- Easier version history for content changes
- Cleaner separation of content and layout

### 2026-02-16 — Project spotlight: Course Compass
**Tags:** portfolio, product, education

Course Compass helps students map degree requirements into semester plans while surfacing scheduling risk early.

Current focus is improving recommendation confidence and better visualizing requirement dependencies.

### 2026-02-10 — Project spotlight: SnapBudget
**Tags:** portfolio, finance, habits

SnapBudget is a lightweight budgeting app that leans into behavior design, not just expense logging.

I am currently tuning recurring-charge detection and weekly check-in reminders.
