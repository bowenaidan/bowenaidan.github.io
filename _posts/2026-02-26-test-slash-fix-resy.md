I need to set resy-cli to dry-run at 9am and check the logs to see if i have successfully mad it faster.

If it still does not get the reservation, I need to troubleshoot and come up with a new solution.

UPDATE:

Fixed! Changed the poll interval to every 100ms and was able to find a few prime time reservations. We'll see how that is for days like friday and saturday, but now I'm confident that I could make it sufficiently fast if need be.
