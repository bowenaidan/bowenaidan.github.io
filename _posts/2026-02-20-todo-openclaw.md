Need to set up OpenClaw once I can get my hands on a spare mac.

I keep forgetting to get the spare MacBook from my friend so I can check out what all the hype is about. Ideally I would have it do some of these backlog items for me. I'm also interested in its research ability and what it could possibly do for some of my private side projects when I'm busy with my day job. It would also be nice to have a spare macbook so I can use OpenBubbles from my linux machine. I'm currently in the process to seeing how close Fedora can get to being a Mac.

While I'm thinking about it, here are some things I may be interested in doing with OpenClaw:
- Scheduling reservations
- Running research jobs for market research on personal projects. 
- Creating project prototypes for things I've had on my backlog for quite some time
- Addressing incoming tasks while I am at work

Pretty exciting stuff here, but I understand the risks OpenClaw poses are pretty severe so I need to be careful and not be an idiot.

Hopefully I can get started on this soon and make an entry under projects!
