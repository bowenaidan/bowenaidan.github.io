I moved this site to a Ruby markdown workflow so publishing updates is frictionless.

Tracking and publishing work is as simple as creating a new 'blog' post. I don't intend for this to become a real blog as I am not much for writing. However there are benfits of doing this:

- keeping myself accountable
- documenting my learnings so I can see my progress clearly
- kind of a cool concept to play around with
